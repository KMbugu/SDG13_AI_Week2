# Ethical Considerations

## Potential Biases
- **MNIST Model**:
  - **Bias**: The MNIST dataset is clean and balanced but may not generalize to real-world handwriting variations (e.g., cultural differences in digit styles). Models trained on MNIST might perform poorly on diverse scripts, impacting fairness in applications like educational digitization (SDG 4).
  - **Mitigation**: Use TensorFlow Fairness Indicators to evaluate model performance across subgroups (e.g., by digit style or source). Augment the dataset with diverse handwriting samples to improve robustness.
- **Amazon Reviews Model**:
  - **Bias**: The review dataset may be skewed toward certain demographics (e.g., English-speaking, affluent users), missing perspectives from underrepresented groups. Sentiment analysis may misinterpret sarcasm or cultural nuances.
  - **Mitigation**: spaCyâ€™s rule-based systems can be customized with domain-specific rules to handle nuances (e.g., slang). Use diverse datasets (e.g., multilingual reviews) and fairness tools to assess bias in entity recognition and sentiment scoring.

## Promoting Fairness
Both models align with SDG goals (e.g., SDG 4 for education, SDG 12 for consumption) by providing transparent, data-driven insights. Regular audits using fairness tools and inclusive datasets ensure equitable outcomes.
